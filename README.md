# Life Compass

Visualize your life balance and get AI-powered recommendations for a more fulfilling life.

## About The Project

Life Compass is an interactive web application designed to help you reflect on and improve your life balance. Based on the popular "Wheel of Life" coaching tool, this app allows you to rate your satisfaction across eight key areas of your life. The results are instantly visualized on a radar chart, giving you a clear snapshot of your current life balance.

The app's standout feature is its integration with generative AI. After assessing your life areas, you can receive personalized, actionable recommendations from an AI coach to help you focus on areas that need attention and create a more harmonious life.
